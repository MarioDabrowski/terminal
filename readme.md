##### Autocomplete

When you start typing the name of a file of folder to autocomplete just hit the [TAB] key and it will autocomplete the name for you (as long as the file or folder exists). EX. You have a folder named 'images' and you begin typing 'ima' then hit [TAB] it will autocomplete 'images' for you.


##### Switching Between Tabs

```
Command + Shift + [
Command + Shift + ]
```


##### Placing the cursor in a specific position using mouse click:

```
option + click
```
